# Hey, I'm Edward Jack

I'm a security analyst at a nonprofit healthcare organization. I'm into red teaming, antivirus evasion, and other cool stuff in the offensive security space. I am currently working throught the Pen-200 course from OSCP and I currently hold my SSCP certification from ISC².

##  What I Plan to Write About
- MITRE ATT&CK techniques especially evasion tactics
- Red team tooling and tradecraft
- Bug bounty findings and write-ups
- Retired HTB machines

## 🛠️ Projects (Coming Soon)
I'm currently setting up my blog and workspace. Projects will be added as I build out tools and write-ups.
